# Dotfiles

These are my .files including vim, zsh, git, and tmux configurations. Check out [laptop][laptop] project for the installer script and installation guide.

Feel free to use it and even make suggestions, however I may decline changes if there's no value to me.

My old .files are still available at https://github.com/janesmae/ye_olde_dotfiles/.
